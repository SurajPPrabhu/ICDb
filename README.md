# Integrated COMETS Database (ICDb)
Database project to host and retrieve COMETS files. Designed for the [Segre lab](https://www.bu.edu/segrelab/) (Boston University).

## What is COMETS?
Computation of microbial ecosystems in time and space (COMETS) is a Python module that extends dynamic ï¬‚ux balance analysis to generate simulations of multiple microbial species in molecularly complex and spatially structured environments. The module is fed multiple simulation files: models, layout, media, and parameters. 

## What is our project about?
With this project, we aim to create a one-stop shop that provides users access to a database where they can upload and download the model, media, and barrier files. This would help the Segre lab in storing and retrieving specific files instead of browsing multiple databases. 
To achieve this, we will be building a database that hosts the model, media, and barrier files. The end goal of our database is to help the user find the files they are looking for easily. This project will serve as a proof of concept and if it is successful the lab may decide to expand it and add other types of files to the database in the future. 

## How to access the database?
To access the database, click [here](https://www.google.com/). On the website, the user is able to search for keywords corresponding to a model, barrier, and media file. The user can then download the requested files in the specific COMETSpy (Python interface for COMETS) format. Users will also be able to upload their files to the database so that they do not have to keep redefining the values they have already used.
